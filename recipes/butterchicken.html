    <h2>Here is the recipe of butter chicken</h2>
    
    <p>Tender and juicy chicken thanks to a deliciously spiced yogurt marinade, Butter Chicken is ridiculously easy to make. The curry sauce is out of this world!</p>
    
    <p>The best part about cooking up Butter Chicken at home is the ingredients list. Every ingredient is easy to find from any grocery store or supermarket.</p>

    <h3>Recipe YAY!</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Use boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breasts.</li>
        <li>First, mix your yogurt marinade together.</li>
        <li>Marinate chicken for 20 minutes, or overnight if time allows. (The longer it marinates, the more tender your chicken will be.)</li>
        <li>Sear chicken in a skillet or pan. Keep those charred bits on the pan to make your sauce. Browned bits = flavour. If you have too many burnt pieces stuck to the pan, you can discard some of them if you wish.</li>
        <li>Finally, make your curry sauce in the same skillet.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <li>28 oz (800g) boneless and skinless chicken thighs or breasts cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
